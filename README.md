# MakeCode Extension for Nexus:bit and NexusBot

Nexus:bit is a powerful BBC micro:bit multiple-purpose extension board made by Taiwan Coding Education Association:

* onboard rechargable 18650 lithium battery with reverse current/over charging protection
* miniature joystick/botton board (the connection slots can also be used to install a HC-SR04/HC-SR04P ultrasonic sensor)
* onboard amplified buzzer (P0; can be disconnceted by removing a jumper), vibrator motor (P8), microphone (P12), servo pin (P12) and a RGB LED (PCA9685 Pin 13-15)
* 12 PCA9685 servo pins
* 2 DC motor pins (P13-16)
* 5V/3.3V power output pins
* full breakout pins from micro:bit and extra I2C pins

You can control the Nexus:bit by using standard MakeCode blocks and third party PCA9685/Sonar extensions. However this extension/package comes with easy-to-use blocks for all features of Nexus:bit, as well as a library of powerful PCA9685 servo control functions which can be used on all kinds of robots.

NexusBot is a OTTO-like 8-dof biped robot powered by micro:bit and Nexus:bit. This extension has some basic control blocks for this robot.

This extension is also appliable to Thunder:bit V2 motor boards, which is similar to Nexus:bit except microphone and have only 4 PCA9685 servo pins.
